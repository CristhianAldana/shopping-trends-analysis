# Shopping Trends Analysis – Customer Behavior & Sales Insights

This project analyzes customer purchase data to better understand sales trends, customer segments, and payment behavior.  
The main goal was to turn raw data into clear insights that could support business decisions.

## Project Overview

I worked with a dataset containing customer demographics, purchase information, and payment methods.  
The analysis focuses on identifying which products sell the most, which customer segments generate more revenue, and how customers prefer to pay.

The entire process was done using Excel, with a strong focus on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Preparation

Before analyzing the data, I cleaned and transformed it using Power Query.  
This included:

- Verifying and correcting data types  
- Cleaning text fields  
- Creating a final curated table (gold table) to use as a single source of truth  

All KPIs, pivot tables, and visualizations are built from this final table.

## KPIs and Analysis

Some of the main KPIs analyzed in this project are:

- Total sales  
- Sales by product category  
- Sales by customer age group and gender  
- Sales by payment method  
- Sales by customer value segment  

To make the analysis more meaningful, I created additional columns such as age groups and customer value segments directly in Power Query.

## Key Insights

- Clothing represents the category with the highest contribution to total sales.  
- Adult and senior customers generate the highest revenue across genders.  
- Credit cards are the most commonly used payment method, especially among higher-value customer segments.  
- These patterns suggest opportunities to focus promotions on high-value customers and encourage higher purchase amounts through targeted offers.

## Dashboard

The final result is an interactive Excel dashboard that highlights the main KPIs and allows filtering by age group, gender, customer segment, category, and payment method.
